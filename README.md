# About

NeoOrechards is a mod that ports vadis365's "Sky Orchards" to 1.21.1

This mod is in alpha, expect lots of bugs.

Current version allows for the creation of custom saplings through a toml file. 
This is very finicky and any minor mistake in the file will either cause the game to purposely crash, or revert back to "default".
